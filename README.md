# Hotel Booking Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on hotel booking data to investigate cancellation patterns and identify measures to reduce cancellations and increase revenue. The dataset contains booking information for both city hotels and resort hotels, including details such as booking dates, length of stay, number of guests, and room types.

## Project Goals

- Analyze hotel booking data to understand cancellation patterns and factors influencing them.
- Identify actionable insights to reduce cancellations and optimize revenue for hotels.
- Provide recommendations to stakeholders based on EDA findings and analysis.

## Project Structure

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: 
   - Explore and inspect raw data.
   - Handle data impurities, null values, and irrelevant data.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Conduct univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to study data relationships.
   - Visualize data to uncover patterns and insights.
   
3. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - Analyze findings to suggest measures for reducing cancellations and increasing revenue.
   - Provide recommendations for adjusting customer strategies and improving hotel performance.
